responsive-tables
=================

Prototypes of responsive tables with expandable rows, selection column (using radio buttons or checkboxes), and action column.

Column and row resize, detail expansion and check-all events are implemented using jQuery.

To run, simply open the HTML file in your browser. There are several versions that include/exclude the features described above.
